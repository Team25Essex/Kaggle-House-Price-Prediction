I change our encoder to CatEncoder, and I add a new model called LightBoost. I also add two new functions, Function features for regularization 
to see the importance of each column and only remain the useful columns, Function check helps us to see the score immediately so no need to sumbit
our file serveral times.
If you want to move the code to colab, there might be import issue due to the lack of file "category_encoders", the link is provided here:

Wish you can improve our rank
Best wish
Tim.
